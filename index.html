<h1>
  Intern Report
</h1>

<p>
  Designveloper is a company that connects the Designer & Developer, that's why
  the company has a very good review on the internet about. Luckily, I had a
  chance to intern at this company with the role developer. The company mainly
  focuses on React framework and some others like MeteorJS, TDD, MochaJS,
  NodeJS, … Because I have the knowledge on the ReactJS so my project is about
  building an e-commercial website about selling cloth. This project requires
  using React JS for building Front End & and NodeJS for building BackEnd. Both
  of them are connected together by MeteorJS. After the first week, my project
  was interrupted and I need to move to the other project about React Native and
  Guitar. This is a simple mobile application that gives the user a topic for
  practicing guitar. I had created React Native application before with a team,
  but now with this project, I’m alone, and I feel a little bit nervous. But I
  think I love this project a lot. Because I’m a guitarist also, that’s why when
  making an application about music because it will help me develop both skills.
  I worked on this project with all my passion. Although there are some
  problems, but with the help of my mentor, I can easily get through all of
  them. This app is also the first app that I deploy to both Appstore and Google
  Play. Both of them are successfully deployed. I really hope that I will have a
  chance to continue on the next version of this application. It will be
  interesting. Actually, I think that currently I’m the most suitable for
  working on this project in Designveloper. Why? Because I have experience on
  music theory. I will develop the app and the content of the app faster than
  whom without knowledge of music theory. I think that although I’m working on
  React Native application. But I’m still interested in MeteorJS. Because
  MeteorJS is a very strong framework for realtime project. And I like
  everything that realtime. This is the end of the blog I want to say during my
  internship. Thanks for reading.
