            Designveloper is a company that connects the Designer & Developer,
            that's why the company has a very good review on the internet about.
          </h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">
            The company mainly focuses on React framework and some others like
            MeteorJS, TDD, MochaJS, NodeJS, … Because I have the knowledge on
            the ReactJS so my project is about building an e-commercial website
            about selling cloth. <br />
            <br />
            This project requires using React JS for building Front End & and
            NodeJS for building BackEnd. Both of them are connected together by
            MeteorJS.<br />
            <br />

            After the first week, my project was interrupted and I need to move
            to the other project about React Native and Guitar. This is a simple
            mobile application that gives the user a topic for practicing
            guitar. I had created React Native application before with a team,
            but now with this project, I’m alone, and I feel a little bit
            nervous.<br />
            <br />

            But I think I love this project a lot. Because I’m a guitarist also,
            that’s why when making an application about music because it will
            help me develop both skills.<br />
            <br />

            I worked on this project with all my passion. Although there are
            some problems, but with the help of my mentor, I can easily get
            through all of them.<br />
            <br />

            This app is also the first app that I deploy to both Appstore and
            Google Play. Both of them are successfully deployed.<br />
          </p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-64 w3-container">
      <div class="w3-content">
        <div class="w3-center">
          <p class="w3-text-grey">
            I really hope that I will have a chance to continue on the next
            version of this application. It will be interesting. <br />
            <br />
            Actually, I think that currently I’m the most suitable for working
            on this project in Designveloper. Why?<br />
            <br />
            Because I have experience on music theory. I will develop the app
            and the content of the app faster than whom without knowledge of
            music theory.<br />
            <br />
            I think that although I’m working on React Native application. But
            I’m still interested in MeteorJS. Because MeteorJS is a very strong
            framework for realtime project. And I like everything that realtime.
